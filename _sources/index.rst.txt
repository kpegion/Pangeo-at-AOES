This is a collection of information and example Jupyter Notebooks, for using the Python and the Pangeo Software stack for data analysis.  This set of examples is specifically designed for the Mason AOES/COLA Servers, datasets available on our servers, and use cases around common data analyses used by our students and faculty.


The examples are also generally relevant for climate data analysis.  Therefore, an External Tutorial is also provided in Binder for those without access to the Mason AOES/COLA Servers.
